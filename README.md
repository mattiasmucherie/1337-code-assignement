# 1337 Code Assignment

I have chosen to focuse on these points:

| Design/access | Functionality | Testing/QA  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| Responsive design, works on mobile and tablets **(2pt)**      | Sort by name and office **(1pt)** | Works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge **(1pt)** |
| No UI framework used (such as Bootstrap, Ant) **(1pt)**      | Filter by name and office **(1pt)**      |   Unit tests for existing functionality (reasonable coverage) **(2pt)** |
|  | Enable switch between a grid and a different view (such as list) **(1pt)**      |    |
| | Available on a free public url (suck as Azure, Heroku) **(1pt)** | |

This should account for **10 points**
