      '<p>With a Bachelor\'s degree in Human Resources, working with sales was not something I envisioned, but my passion for Sales has grown over time and keeps growing.</p><p>During my studies, I thought you need to be "pushy" to work in sales, but the insight that sales are all about being interested in people, creating value, and connecting with people from different backgrounds has made me want to keep developing in that field.</p><p>Working in Tech has always been a long-term goal. Like so many others, my interest in Tech started at an early age. It began, as it so often does, with playing video games, which in turn sparked my interest in computers.</p><p>In my spare time, I\'m somewhat of a sports fanatic. I spend endless hours either watching or playing/training football, padel, or Crossfit.</p>  ',

      "<p>A profession in development wasn't a choice but an eventuality. It started with a love of taking things apart and putting them back together again. I could not only do that with computers, but I could extend them too. When they were whole they were also more useful, even if my definition of useful back then was running MUD's and building primitive websites.</p><p>This profession gives the most enjoyment when things are working; the team, the software, the coffee machine. I enjoy the challenge of been one step ahead of the software, anticipating and informing on its potential risks, working with the team to produce something someone will love.</p><p>Free time is precious. I say that each hour is worth 3x your hourly wage. It should be spent wisely, doing things you enjoy with people you like. I spend mine at my farm, growing crops and renovating. I also love brewing and experimenting with beer, as often as possible using the produce from the farm. Otherwise I'm in the blacksmith or the wood shop, learning from the masters and making items we can use in our daily life.​</p>   ",
